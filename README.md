# Text Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras
## Overview
This project utilizes deep learning techniques implemented with TensorFlow and Keras to perform sentiment analysis on textual data. The dataset consists of text samples labeled with corresponding sentiments, and the goal is to train a model to accurately classify the sentiment of unseen text samples.

## Setup
Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:
## Usage
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script sentiment_analysis.py.
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the text data, build and train the deep learning model, and evaluate its performance.
Optionally, you can modify hyperparameters, model architecture, or preprocessing steps in the script to improve performance.
Dataset
The dataset consists of textual data samples labeled with corresponding sentiments (positive, negative, neutral). Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and accessible by the script.

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model architecture is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API. It typically includes embedding layers, recurrent layers (e.g., LSTM), dense layers, and activation functions. You can customize the architecture to suit your specific requirements.

## Training
Training the model involves optimizing its parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent. The training process iterates over the dataset multiple times (epochs) to improve the model's performance. Early stopping may be applied to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on a validation set to assess its performance metrics such as accuracy and loss. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn may be used to analyze the training history.

## Testing
The trained model can be used to predict the sentiment of new text samples. The script includes a function predict_emotions() to demonstrate how to utilize the model for sentiment prediction.
